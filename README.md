# stock_analysis
stockanalysis -- Some general work done with stock anaylsis.  This github repository holds some stock data compliling and does not include analysis.


//Notes:  Could have done a binary search in order to minimize the times because nested for loops take O(n^2) time.  Thus, downloading the data takes an immense amount of time.  Or could have just utilized a different data structure to minimize download times.
